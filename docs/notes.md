### SWEET
SWEET has become the *de facto* upper-level ontology for Earth scientists.

### Sowa's top level categories

### StructuralGeoOntology
It is unclear how much of this "ontology" has actually been created.  There are references suggesting many of the components *could* be created, or *would* be needed.  However, from this viewer's perspective, most of the "ontologies" are depicted via UML -- suggesting they all exist using roughly the same formal semantics.



#### Logical Languages
- Web Ontology Language (OWL) -- the current, updated, version is [OWL 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/); the initial version, referenced in many of the published material, is [OWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/).  There is no distinction between versions, only expressiveness when available.
- Knowledge Interchange Format ([KIF](http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/Hypertext/kif-manual.html))
- Common Logic ([CL](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=39175))


dependencies / related field
Further, many ontologies are not static.  There are situations where an ontology was developed, published, and then became another ontology or set of ontologies.  When this has been explicitly stated, the ontologies are connected via the "dependencies / related" field in the table.  This is currently in flux.  In the future there will be a "previous" or "provenance" field for this signifying this metamorphosis.
