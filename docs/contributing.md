## contributing
Your contributions are welcome!
<br /><br />
### (rough) guidelines
* Add one ontology per issue or pull request.
* Add the link to the [project-name](http://example.com/) (if possible).
* Add a *very* brief description.
* Search previous suggestions prior to creating an issue or pull request to help minimise duplicates.
* Add the relevant citation(s).
* Check spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.
* Submit issue or pull request.

[//]: # (I would keep some pull requests open if I'm not sure whether the libraries are awesome, you could [vote for them](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python/pulls) by adding :+1: to them.)
