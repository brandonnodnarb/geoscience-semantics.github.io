### preliminaries
A few caveats to consider when viewing the information on this site.

#### <u>on categorisation</u>
The following geoscience semantic models are organised based (loosely) on the ***semantic spectrum*** [1-6], with particular focus on the high level categorisations described in [7].  

The criteria distinguishing between *upper-level*, *domain*, *task*, and *application* ontologies after [2,8,9].

#### <u>on order</u>
The ontologies are listed by name, where available, in chronological order by publication year.  Where the structure was not explicitly named, a logical equivalent is provided in *italics*.  Links are to project homepages and/or repositories if those resources exist.


#### <u>on multiplicity</u>
Many papers discuss more than one ontology.  In most cases each ontology is referenced here individually.  In some cases multiple "ontologies" are mentioned in the publication even when referring to multiple OWL files representing one discussed ontology.  The delineation of object models and process models is often murky.  If possible---i.e. if there is enough information in the paper and/or documentation---each model is listed separately as an individual ontology.  

Further, many ontologies are not static.  There are situations where an ontology was developed, published, and then became another ontology or set of ontologies.  When this has been explicitly stated, the ontologies are connected via the "dependencies / related" field in the table.  This is currently in flux.  In the future there will be a "previous" or "provenance" field for this signifying this metamorphosis.
