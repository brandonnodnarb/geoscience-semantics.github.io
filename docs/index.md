### preliminaries
A few details to consider when viewing the information on this site.

####<u>on table elements</u>
Table information is as follows.  This is a maximal set of column information.  Some tables will have a subset of these elements.  In each case the information provided is consistent with the following:

| column                  | description/metadata                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| name                    | The name of the ontology, or any model, is taken directly from the text when at all possible.  However, in the event the model was not explicitly named, a descriptive name has been provided and displayed in this column using *italics*. |
| citation                | The initial citation is presented.  There is often more than one.  This column, like most of the site, should be considered fluid. |
| brief synopsis          | This is currently *very* brief, intended only to convey enough information to distinguish the model in question from others. | 	
| expressivity marker     | Any notion of expressivity that was provided by the author is presented here.  This is most often a self-description by the author(s) as it relates to W3C standards (i.e. OWL, RDF, SKOS, etc.).  In the rare case where the ontology is available, the model has been analysed using the OWL API. |
| dependency or related   | If the ontology is related to, or extends, another structure---i.e. extends SWEET, or maps to DOLCE, etc.---this information is provided.  This is most often gleaned from the text of the publication. |

#### <u>on categorisation</u>
The following geoscience semantic models are organised based (loosely) on the ***semantic spectrum*** [1-6], with particular focus on the high level categorisations described in [7].  

The criteria distinguishing between *upper-level* (here *Foundational*), *domain*, *task*, and *application* ontologies derived from [2,8,9] when at all possible.

#### <u>on order</u>
The ontologies are listed chronologically by publication date within their appropriate section, and by name when multiple models have been published in a calendar year.  

#### <u>on multiplicity</u>
Many papers discuss more than one ontology.  In most cases each ontology is referenced here individually.  In some cases multiple "ontologies" are mentioned in the publication when referring to multiple OWL files representing "an ontology".  If possible---i.e. if there is enough information in the paper and/or documentation---each model is listed separately as an individual ontology.

The delineation of object and process models is often murky.  Currently, both types of models are listed in the domain ontologies section.  This is an interim solution until further review is completed (i.e. they will be separated in the not too distant future).   

#### <u>on linked resources</u>
Links are to project homepages and/or repositories if those resources exist.  Links to the actual ontology (or model) files are being considered---when the resource is considered "openly" available.  Citations will have links to publications in the not too distant future.
