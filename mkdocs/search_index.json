Where the structure was not given a name explicitly, a logical equivalent is given in \nitalics\n.  Links on this page are to project homepages and/or repositories.\n\n\non multiplicity\n\n\nMany papers discuss more than one ontology.  In most cases each ontology is referenced here.  In some cases multiple \"ontologies\" are mentioned in the publication, when in fact they are referring to multiple OWL files for one ontology.  There are also cases where an object model is discussed with a corresponding process model.  If possible (i.e. if there is enough information in the paper and/or documentation) these have been listed separately.  Further, there are ontological lineages of models -- i.e. an ontology was developed and in time/development became another structure.  When this is known (i.e. explicitly stated somewhere) the ontologies are connected via the \"dependencies / related\" field in the table.\n\n\n\n\nLogical Languages\n\n\n\n\nWeb Ontology Language (OWL) -- the current, updated, version is \nOWL 2\n; the initial version, referenced in many of the published works, is \nOWL\n.
